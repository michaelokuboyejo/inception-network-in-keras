Building Inception Networks With Keras
-------------

This simple project is a Keras implementation of a simple Inception Network.

To test the network, I trained it on the MNIST hand written digit data set and made a submission for the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).

The outcome:
